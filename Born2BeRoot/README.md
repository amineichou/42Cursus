## Introduction

### What is a `virtual machine` ?
- A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer.
- It enables you to run multiple operating systems (OS) or instances of the same OS on a single physical machine, known as the host machine.

### What is a `Hypervisor`?
- A hypervisor is a software or firmware that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs) by allowing multiple operating systems to share a single hardware host. It enables the virtualization of computer hardware, essentially acting as a layer between the physical hardware and the virtual machines.
- Types of hypervisors :
1. Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor): This type runs directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and manage guest operating systems. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.
2. Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor): This type runs on top of a host operating system and allows multiple guest operating systems to run within it. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.

### What is `LVM` ?
- LVM (Logical Volum Manager) is a system used on Linux to manage storage devices and create logical storage volumes. It provides a layer of abstraction between physical storage devices and the file systems mounted on these devices. 

### what is `File System` ?
- is a method used by an operating system to organize and store files on a storage medium, such as a hard drive, solid-state drive, or any other storage device. It provides structure and a set of rules for how data is stored, accessed, and managed.

### What is `appArmor` ?
- AppArmor is a Linux kernel security module used for access control and mandatory access control (MAC). It acts as an additional layer of security to confine programs, processes, or applications within predefined security profiles, limiting their capabilities and access to system resources.
- Check appArmor status `sudo aa-status`

### `apt` vs `aptitude` :
- apt and aptitude are package management tools in Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu. They serve similar purposes but have some differences in their functionalities and user interfaces.

### What is `SSH` ?
- SSH stands for Secure Shell, which is a network protocol that allows secure communication between two computers by establishing a secure connection. It's commonly used for remote access to systems, file transfers, and executing commands on a remote machine.
1. connect ssh : `ssh username@ip_address -p PORT`
2. Check that the "SSH" service is installed : `dpkg -l | grep ssh`
3. Check that the SSH is working : `sudo service ssh status`

### `TCP` vs `UDP`
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used for transmitting data over networks, but they have different characteristics and are suited for different purposes.
- TCP:
    TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets between devices.
    Connection-Oriented: TCP establishes a connection between two devices before data transfer begins.
    Slower but More Reliable.
- UDP:
    UDP does not establish a connection before transmitting data and does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or error-checking of data packets.
    Faster, Lower Overhead.

### What is a `Firewall`?
- A firewall is a network security system designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet), filtering the traffic that passes through it.

### UFW
1. ufw stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. It is a user-friendly front-end for managing netfilter, the firewall in the Linux kernel (specifically, iptables). It simplifies the process of setting up and managing a firewall on Linux systems.
2. Check that the "UFW" program is installed : `dpkg -l | grep ufw`
3. Check that it is working properly : `sudo service ufw status`
4. List the active rules in UFW : `sudo ufw status`
5. Add a new rules to open port 8080 : `sudo ufw allow 8080`
6. Delete the new rule : `sudo ufw delete 8080`
#### Basic Commands :
- `ufw enable` : Turns on the firewall.
- `ufw disable` : Turns off the firewall.
- `ufw allow|deny` : Sets the default behavior for incoming connections.
- `ufw allow <port>/<protocol>` : Opens a specific port for a protocol.
- `ufw deny <port>/<protocol>` : Denies access to a specific port for a protocol.

### SUDO :
- stands for "superuser do" and is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to execute commands with elevated privileges or as another user, typically the system administrator (superuser or root).
- `sudo command`
- Check if sudo is installed : `dpkg -l sudo`

### USER :
#### 1. Check that a user has been added and to the "sudo" group or any other group.
- `getent group sudo` / `getent group group_name`
#### 2. Create a new user :
-  `sudo adduser username`
- assign a password to it resoecting the password quality rules.
- verify password expire info for new user using chage command : `sudo chage -l username`
- assign the new user to sudo group: `sudo adduser username sudo`
- assign the new user to user42 group: `sudo adduser username user42`
#### 3. Create a group and add the new user to this group.
- creating new group: `sudo groupadd groupname`
- add the new user to the new group: `sudo adduser username groupname`
#### 4. Check if that user belongs to the "evaluating" group.
- `sudo getent group evaluating`

### Hostname :
- Get hostname : `hostname`
- Change hostname: `sudo vim /etc/hostname` + reboot the machine : `sudo reboot`

### Partitions :
- Check partitions: `lsblk`
